## My process

- I started by going through the resources and planning my solution flow.
- To get the design perfectly, I used Photoshop to determine the color code for the background color and the dimensions of the qr code.
- After fi.ishing up with the design, I had to go learn how to publish my solution to GITHUB so that I cann be able to submit the link to my solution
- After the tutorial, I was able to publish my design and my code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
